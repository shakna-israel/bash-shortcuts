# bash-shortcuts
A series of modifications to .bashrc to make life easier.

The file ```~/.bashrc``` is used by Linux shells using bash, to create various commands. You can make quite complex, and quite simple ones.

This repository holds a series of files, all of which can be added to your own ```~/.bashrc``` to make life simpler.

To make the repository more manageable, they will be in their own files. Not just one giant file you can copy over.
