# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, but should follow a similar style to the project.

* Additional shortcuts should be stored in their own file.
* Only one new shortcut per pull request.
* The file produced should not have a file extension.
* You should include an explanation and example of the shortcut in comments, as seen in existing shortcuts.
* You should create a new branch before making a pull request. **Pull requests on a master branch will not be accepted.**

When editing existing shortcuts:

* Explain the need for a change.
* Explain what you changed.

When doing either of the above, feel free to add your name as a contributor to the bottom of the README.md
